 anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "A form of socialism that wishes to abolish all unjustified hierarchies, such as the state, which has the ability to pass laws for all communities without consent and force people to follow them with the police, and capitalism, which forces employees to do the command of the CEO of the company. Anarchism thus seeks to replace capitalism with socialism, and abolish the state, the police, and prisons, and instead give communities the power of self governance, and solve crime by finding and fixing the causes of crime, and abolish money, where all can take what they need."
 communalism_subtype_desc:0 "Confederation of Communes"
 marxism_subtype_desc:0 "A form of socialism that believes that because workers have no control at work over their actions, the product they make, and to make human relations, due to the fact these are instead dictated by capitalists, become estranged and lose sense of themselves, and that by giving workers control over their labor would fix this. They also believe that since the workers do all labor, and capitalists do none of it, merely dictating what the workers do, capitalists are like leeches, that lower the wages of workers as much as possible to increase profits and must be removed from power, and control given entirely to the workers. They also believe that money motivates people to make a profit, and not people's needs. And so they wish to create a socialist society, where workers have control over production and the government, where there is no state, and there is no money, and instead all can take anything for free according to their need."
 marxism-leninism_subtype__desc:0 "a form of socialism and a form of marxism, that believes in order to achieve socialism, the working class must be organized into a centralized vanguard party that will protect the working class from external and internal threats and to lead them in a revolution, and take control of the state, and use it as a tool. They also believe that this party should operate by the principle of democratic centralism, which believes that once a majority vote has been reached, discussion on the issue should cease to prevent the party from falling apart from disagreements."
 social-democracy_subtype_desc:0 "A form of Liberalism that believes that capitalism has problems, but can best be fixed by passing large reforms, such as making certain goods and services free, redistributing wealth, and so on."
 conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism believes in preserving traditional culture and institutions, however, because what is traditional is different from country to country, conservatism varies from country to country, ranging anywhere from feudalism to liberal capitalist democracy. In the context of the politics of this time period, it usually specifically means preserving Neoliberalism, believing in preserving the traditional system of the government of (mostly) not interfering in the market, and even if it does, at most providing only minimal things, such as a small minimum wage, or basic worker protections."
 nationalism_subtype_desc:0 "Nationalism isn't exactly an ideology per se, but rather a set of various movements across the world and different time periods that all share similar characteristics and believes, but don't necessarily share the exact same beliefs or at all call themselves the same name. Nationalism believes that the country and the people of the nation are of the upmost importance, even above that of other countries and people, and that all should feel nationalistic pride towards one country, and put all their efforts into making it great."
 authoritarianism_subtype_desc:0 "This is not an ideology per se, but rather a system of government in which the government has large control over the personal lives of the people, such as suppressing free speech, freedom of assembly, censoring the media, and so on. The government is usually non democratic, or only partially so."
 fascism_subtype_desc:0 "Fascism isn’t exactly an ideology per se, but rather a set of various movements across the world and during different time periods that all share similar characteristics and beliefs, but don’t necessarily share the exact same beliefs or all call themselves the same name. Fascism is usually characterized by the belief that a certain people and the country are of the utmost importance with almost mythical like ultranationalistic overtones, that the country used to be great once but is due to rise again, and the demonization of other peoples to be the source of societies problems and the downfall from greatness, those people being made a scapegoat, and that only their people are deserving to live in the country, and since the others are seen as the cause of all problems in society, should be removed, through methods such as deportation, segregation, and genocide."
